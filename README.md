# DanceDanceRevolution DanceStages + Characters Super Phase

Hey there, fellow dancers! It's been a while, but I'm back with some exciting news to share. I hope you've all been doing well, and I'm thrilled to reconnect and bring something awesome to the table.

## Latest Update Available

## What's New?

- DDR SuperNOVA DanceStages have been included, along with an extra stage.

- New Camera motions, reminiscent of DDR SuperNOVA.

- Added an option to customize the environment color based on the DanceStage main color, affecting the Character, similar to DDR SuperNOVA (Only available for SuperNOVA DanceStages)

- Enjoy new DanceRoutines (though not directly from DDR, they're still awesome).

- You now have the option to toggle character shadows on or off.

- Exciting news! I've got a new patch for XX STARLiGHT -twopointzero- v2.1.0HF. (Stay tuned for more patches for other themes - reach out to your favorite themer for details!)

- I've given the Characters + DanceStages selection menu a fresh new design, making it more convenient and user-friendly.

- Get ready to party with up to 8 characters, but be warned, it requires a powerful CPU and GPU.

## Instructions:

Let's get you up and dancing with these simple instructions:

### APPLYING THE UPDATE

1. Make sure you have the base files or a DDR DanceStages + Characters Update previously installed (You can download the base files [HERE](https://codeload.github.com/Enciso0720/Enciso0720DDR/zip/refs/heads/main) (If you're new here, make sure to place the base files in the root folder of Stepmania/Project OutFox)).

1. Then, ***MAKE SURE TO DELETE THE Characters/DanceRepo AND Characters/None FOLDERS.***

1. Once deleted, download the last update file on the Release section, and extract it into the Stepmania/Project OutFox root folder, replacing or adding new content to the Characters and DanceStages folders.

### APPLYING THE THEME PATCH

1. Download the XX STARLiGHT -twopointzero- v2.1.0HF theme from its official Github page (And install it as usual in the Appearance > Themes folder).

1. Download the patch included in the Release section.

1. Extract the patch into the XX STARLiGHT -twopointzero- v2.1.0HF theme folder, replacing the files.

### SETTING UP THE GAME

Once you have patched and configured the XX STARLiGHT -twopointzero- v2.1.0HF as your theme, set the following:

- Main Menu > Options > Graphics/Sound Options > Video Renderer: GLAD

- Main Menu > Options > Display Options > Appearance Options > Brightness: 100%.

## What's Coming in the Future?

• I'm working on bringing DDR II DanceStages to the mix.

• There's a possibility of future updates replacing the Characters bones (Note: No more DanceRoutines will be released for the current bones).

• I'm aware of the Red Dolphin stage's slow loading time and will optimize it in future updates.

<sub>* Everything mentioned above won't affect what I have planned for the next update.</sub>
